# VAA Question Similarity & Clone-Robust Weighting

This repository contains the codebase for the paper analyzing semantic similarity between political questions in the Swiss Voting Advice Application (VAA), SmartVote. An extended version of the paper can be found in `paper/paper_full_version.pdf`.

**Core Research Question:** How do voter-candidate recommendations change when identical or near-identical questions are added to the VAA questionnaire, and can Clone-Robust Weighting (CRW) correct this distortion?

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **Embeddings:** `sentence-transformers` (SBERT, E5 multilingual, Jina v3, etc.)
* **Paraphrase Generation:** `openai` (GPT-4o for approximate clones)
* **Data Processing:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
* **External Dependency:** `dependencies/rsfp/` (see below)

## External Dependency

`dependencies/rsfp/` builds on the rsfp code of prior work (reference withheld for anonymous review). The code was incorporated as a full subfolder rather than a git submodule. Minor compatibility changes were applied (no structural changes): imports were converted to relative imports. See `dependencies/README.md` for details.

## Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, it is recommended to use Conda to manage your Python environment and dependencies.

```bash
# 1. Create a new conda environment
conda create --name vqs-env python=3.12 -y

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate vqs-env

## Core Infrastructure & Entry Points

All scripts should be executed as Python modules (e.g., `python -m <module>`) from the project root to ensure local imports resolve correctly.

| Script | Purpose | Example Execution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `main.py` | Unified CLI: dispatches all subcommands (pipeline, compare, generate-clones, experiments). | `python -m main pipeline --config configs/base_pipeline/pipeline_e5_ZH.py` |
| `main.py generate-clones` | Generates cloned question datasets. | `python -m main generate-clones --config configs/create_clones/identical_q32214_n10.py` |
| `main.py compare` | Compares two pipeline runs and generates metrics. | `python -m main compare <run_a.parquet> <run_b.parquet>` |

## The Experiments

The paper's narrative is built on two primary experiments and subsequent analyses. Below is a guide on where to find them and how to execute them.

### Step 0: Model Selection

Determines the optimal embedding model for all subsequent experiments by running the full alpha sweep across all 10 embedding models and 5 clone types. The selected model is then used as the fixed distance metric for Experiments 1 and 2.

**Location:** `experiments/perfect_clones/model_selection.py`

```bash
python -m experiments.perfect_clones.model_selection \
    --config_a configs/base_pipeline/pipeline_e5_ZH.py \
    --config_b configs/experiments/verification/identical_combinedvar_n10_e5_ZH.py
```

---

### Experiment 1: Perfect Clone Experiments

Tests CRW's ability to detect and correct synthetic clones (identical copies, paraphrases, negations) of questionnaire questions.

#### Recommendation Distortion

Clones each of the 75 questions under 5 different clone conditions (identical, easy/hard paraphrase, negation variants), yielding 375 cloned datasets. For each, runs a CRW alpha sweep using the optimal embedding model (E5-INSTRUCT) and measures per-voter recommendation change (Jaccard, Spearman, Kendall).

**Location:** `experiments/perfect_clones/`

Key scripts:
* `recommendation_distortion.py`: 75-question x 5-clone-type x alpha sweep.
* `clone_count_sweep.py`: alpha x clone-count sweep for a single question.

```bash
python -m experiments.perfect_clones.model_selection \
    --config_a configs/base_pipeline/pipeline_e5_ZH.py \
    --config_b configs/experiments/verification/identical_combinedvar_n10_e5_ZH.py
```

#### Partisan Distortion

Measures how cloning specific questions shifts party visibility across voter recommendations. Phase 1 sweeps all 75 questions individually to identify which questions most benefit which parties. Phase 2 applies cumulative CRW correction for the top-k questions benefiting a target party.

**Location:** `experiments/perfect_clones/partisan_distortion.py`

```bash
# Phase 1 (full SLURM sweep):
bash jobs/perfect_clones/launch_partisan.sh

# Phase 2 (requires existing Phase 1 CSV):
python -m experiments.perfect_clones.partisan_distortion \
    --mode phase2 \
    --config configs/base_pipeline/pipeline_e5_instruct_ZH_a03.py \
    --target-party Centre \
    --phase1-csv <path-to-phase1-csv>
```

---

### Experiment 2: Approximate Clone Experiments

Tests CRW on questions that are correlated by voter answer patterns but textually distinct. Adds the top-5 most answer-correlated full-questionnaire questions to the mini (rapide) questionnaire and measures the resulting recommendation and party-visibility distortion across CRW alpha values.

**Location:** `experiments/approximate_clones/`

#### Recommendation Distortion

```bash
python -m experiments.approximate_clones.recommendation_distortion
```

#### Partisan Distortion

```bash
python -m experiments.approximate_clones.partisan_distortion
```

---

### Explanatory Experiments

Supporting analyses that contextualize the primary results.

**Location:** `experiments/explanatory/`

Key scripts:
* `model_benchmark.py`: evaluates 10 embedding models on a synthetic benchmark dataset, providing an explanation of why certain models perform better in the alpha sweep.
  ```bash
  # Run each model on the fake benchmark dataset first (one config per model):
  python -m main --config configs/distance_only/fake/fake_e5_instruct.py
  # Repeat for each config in configs/distance_only/fake/, then evaluate:
  python -m experiments.explanatory.model_benchmark
  ```
* `distances/distance_structure_analysis.py`: analyzes the correlation structure of pairwise question distances, validates embedding models against voter-answer correlation ground truth, and compares within-topic vs. cross-topic distance distributions.
  ```bash
  python -m experiments.explanatory.distances.distance_structure_analysis --section 2,3
  ```
* `question_impact.py`: sweeps all 75 questions, measuring how much each one distorts recommendations when cloned. Used to identify the top-5 most impactful questions for Experiment 1.
  ```bash
  python -m experiments.explanatory.question_impact \
      --config configs/base_pipeline/pipeline_e5_ZH.py
  ```
* `approximate_clones_analysis/`: distance-level analyses for the approximate clone setup (distance distributions, forbidden intervals).
* Additional scripts: `category_analysis.py`, `recommendation_metric_agreement.py`, `compare_recommendation_and_party_distortion.py`, etc.

---

### Abandoned Experiments

**Location:** `experiments/abandoned/`

Experiments retained for completeness but not part of the paper's narrative.

* `question_removal.py`: tested whether CRW can compensate for removed questions (underrepresentation of a topic). CRW's mechanism is downweighting dense clusters; meaningfully upweighting sparse topics is beyond its design.

---

### Verification

**Location:** `experiments/verification/`

One-off scripts verifying correct behavior of individual pipeline components: `verify_clone_identity.py`, `verify_crw_pipeline.py`, `test_result_manager.py`, etc.

---

## Configuration System

The pipeline uses a Python-based inheritance system for configuration.
* Base defaults are defined in `configs/base_constants.py`.
* Specific runs inherit from the base and override parameters (e.g., `data_year`, `alpha`, `dist`, `embedding_instruction`).
* You can pass CLI overrides to `main.py` directly:
    `python -m main --config configs/base_pipeline/pipeline_e5_ZH.py alpha=0.8 data_year=2019`

---

## Executing on SLURM Cluster

For heavy workloads (alpha sweeps, parallel pipeline runs), use the scripts in `jobs/`. The architecture uses a launcher + generic worker pattern to maximize parallelism: launchers (`launch_*.sh`) run on the login node with plain `bash` and submit the workers (`job_*.sh`).

**Cluster profiles.** The scripts are cluster-agnostic: `#SBATCH` headers only request portable resources (`--time`, `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem-per-cpu`). Everything cluster-specific (conda location, log directory, HuggingFace cache, extra `sbatch` flags such as node exclusions, modules to load) lives in a cluster profile plus an optional local settings file:

* `jobs/clusters/slurm.sh` — generic SLURM profile; every value is a variable with a neutral default.
* `jobs/cluster.local.sh` — machine-specific overrides (conda location, log dir, HF cache, extra `sbatch` args, setup command, data path). Copy `jobs/cluster.local.example.sh`; the file is gitignored.
* `jobs/cluster.conf` — loads the local settings and selects the active profile (default `slurm`). Private profiles can live in the gitignored `jobs/clusters/local/<name>.sh`. Override per call: `CLUSTER=<name> bash jobs/...`.
* `jobs/_lib/common.sh` — shared helpers: `submit` (sbatch wrapper adding logs/profile flags), `activate_env`, `job_preamble`.

The project root is derived from the checkout location, so jobs run from wherever the repository is cloned. Environment variables of the submitting shell (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are forwarded to the jobs.

**Common SLURM Workflows:**
* **Question Impact Sweep (Parallel):**
    `bash jobs/perfect_clones/launch_question_impact.sh`
* **Party Impact Analysis (Phase 1 -> Phase 2):**
    `bash jobs/perfect_clones/launch_partisan.sh`
* **Question Alpha Sweep (all clone types):**
    `bash jobs/perfect_clones/launch_rec_distortion.sh`
* **Single job script:**
    `PIPELINE_CONFIG=configs/base_pipeline/pipeline_e5_ZH.py bash jobs/submit.sh jobs/_generic/job_pipeline_single.sh`
    (prefix any launcher/submit call with `SUBMIT_DRY_RUN=1` to print the `sbatch` commands without submitting)

**Note on Shared File System:** Cache files (`cache/`) are written to a shared NFS. To prevent race conditions during paraphrase generation via the OpenAI API, clone creation jobs must be run in series.

## Data Confidentiality

**IMPORTANT:** Any data containing voter IDs, candidate IDs, or data linked to individual voters/candidates is strictly confidential. Only question data (texts, IDs) is tracked in version control.
